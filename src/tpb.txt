Space Defense Force 9 is a short simple Space Invader's clone with a bit of a twist. It's very short and the only reason it uses an installer instead of being a browser based game is because the license needed to make it a web game was more than it's worth for me. Also, unfortunately this only works on Windows.

I have a lot more content coming out eventually. The project I'm working on now is pretty complex, unlike SDF9, which I made in one night. Hopefully this will get some people interested though.

I've decided to upload my own game for free simply because the Pirate Bay is a great source for distributing content and I believe if something's worth supporting,  people will support it.

Thanks for checking me out! I'll have mroe games out for free for the internets on many more OS's sometime.
